---

## 🔄 Rollback Feature

When a theme is applied:

* The existing `abap_spec.xml` is backed up as `abap_spec.previous_theme.xml`
* Rollback restores this backup, enabling seamless reversion to your previous setup

---

## 📂 Themes Management

✅ **For local usage:**

* Place all `*_theme.xml` files under the `themes/` directory
* They will be auto-detected when running the script locally

✅ **For remote usage:**

* Ensure `themes.json` lists all available themes:

```json
{
  "themes": [
    "A_theme.xml",
    "B_theme.xml"
  ]
}
```

* Files must be accessible via URLs matching the entries in `themes.json`

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

While this script provides a **backup feature** before applying new themes,
you must ensure that your selected XML files are **valid SAP GUI theme files**.

* ✅ Applying an invalid or malformed XML may cause unexpected behavior in your SAP GUI.
* ✅ Always verify the integrity of your theme files before use.
* ✅ Always backup your files.
