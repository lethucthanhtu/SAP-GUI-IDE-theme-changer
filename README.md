```

```powershell
cd SAP-GUI-IDE-theme-changer
```

```

✅ **Local execution features:**

---

### **Run Remotely via IWR**

If hosted on a public server with HTTPS:

```powershell
iwr -useb https://sap.lttt.dev/editor.ps1 | iex
```

⚠️ Note on path input:

* If `Ctrl+V` does not paste your path in the prompt:

* Use `Ctrl+Shift+V`

* Use `Right Click` or `Shift+Insert` to paste

* Alternatively, press `Windows+V` to access your clipboard history and select the copied path

---

## 🔄 Rollback Feature

When a theme is applied:

* The existing `abap_spec.xml` is backed up as `abap_spec.previous_theme.xml`
* Rollback restores this backup, enabling seamless reversion to your previous setup

---

## 📂 Themes Management

✅ **For local usage:**

* Place all `*_theme.xml` files under the `themes/` directory
* They will be auto-detected when running the script locally

✅ **For remote usage:**

* Ensure `themes.json` lists all available themes:

```json
{
  "themes": [
    "A_theme.xml",
    "B_theme.xml"
  ]
}
```

* Files must be accessible via URLs matching the entries in `themes.json`
